AR(*Augmented Reality*) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.

Users play the guitar with [Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) that displays some support information; (1)proper 3D hand models, (2)positions that must be held with hingers, (3)a mirror of the guitar neck tracked based on structural features and (4)evaluations and advices considering frequency features.
